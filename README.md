<h1 align="center">₿ BTC Standard Protocol</h1>
<h3 align="center">Redefining Global Value Under the Satoshi Standard</h3>

---

## 🌍 Overview
The *BTC Standard Protocol* introduces a new monetary framework built entirely upon Bitcoin.  
Its mission is to transition the world from fiat-based valuation systems to a *Bitcoin-denominated economy*,  
where every price, transaction, and asset can be expressed in *satoshis* — the true atomic unit of sound money.

## 🧱 System Architecture

| Layer | Name | Function |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 🌐 *Foundational Layer* | *BTC Standard Protocol* | Defines the Bitcoin-based monetary reference system. |
| 💰 *Stablecoin* | *BitAnchor (bUSD)* | Represents the value of 1 USD in BTC, ensuring short-term stability. |
| ⚡ *Bitcoinized Unit* | *SatStandard (sBTC)* | Expresses all prices directly in satoshis. |
| 🏛 *Governance Layer* | *MonetaBTC Foundation* | Oversees audits, governance, and protocol evolution. |

---

## 💡 Key Concepts
- *bUSD (BitAnchor):* Bitcoin-backed stablecoin pegged to the USD value.  
- *sBTC (SatStandard):* Non-speculative accounting token representing 1 satoshi.  
- *Oracle Bridge:* Real-time BTC/USD feed maintaining consistent peg stability.  
- *Full Transparency:* All collateral and transactions verifiable on-chain.  

---

## 🏁 Mission
To establish *Bitcoin as the universal unit of account*,  
bridging the transition from fiat dependency to a decentralized financial standard.
