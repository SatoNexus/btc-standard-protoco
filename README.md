<h3 align="center">Redefining Global Value Under the Satoshi Standard</h3>

# ⚡ BTC Standard Protocol  

*BTC Standard Protocol* is a decentralized financial framework built entirely on Bitcoin.  
It introduces a *dual-token standard* designed to merge stability and decentralization — enabling the global economy to operate on a Bitcoin-based monetary system.

---

## 🌍 Vision  

To establish a *Bitcoin-denominated global standard*, where prices, wages, and transactions are measured in Bitcoin rather than fiat.  
The BTC Standard Protocol transforms Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a *stable, functional, and universal unit of account*.

---

## 💠 Core Tokens  

### 💰 *BitAnchor (bUSD)*  
A Bitcoin-backed stablecoin pegged to the value of *1 USD in satoshis*.  
It ensures global stability while remaining fully within the Bitcoin ecosystem.  

- *Peg:* 1 bUSD = value of 1 USD in BTC (satoshis)  
- *Purpose:* global trade, payments, liquidity  
- *Advantage:* stability without exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility  

### ⚡ *SatStandard (sBTC)*  
The Bitcoinized unit of value. It expresses prices directly in satoshis, allowing true Bitcoin-based accounting.  

- *Peg:* 1 sBTC = 1 satoshi  
- *Purpose:* pricing, accounting, microtransactions  
- *Advantage:* universal Bitcoin denomination for all markets
