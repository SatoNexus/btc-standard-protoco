|-------|------|-----------|
| 💰 *bUSD (BitAnchor)* | Stablecoin pegged to the USD equivalent in BTC (via satoshi parity). |
| ⚡ *sBTC (SatStandard)* | A Bitcoinized unit of account expressing value directly in satoshis. |

## 🧱 Layered Architecture
| Layer | Component | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 🌐 *Foundation Layer* | *BTC Standard Protocol* | Defines the monetary standard and core smart contracts. |
| 💰 *Stablecoin Layer* | *BitAnchor (bUSD)* | Enables BTC-backed stability without fiat dependency. |
| ⚡ *Unit Layer* | *SatStandard (sBTC)* | Allows goods and services to be priced directly in Bitcoin units. |
