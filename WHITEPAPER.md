# ‚ö° BTC Standard Protocol ‚Äî Whitepaper (v1.0)

## Abstract
The BTC Standard Protocol establishes a new monetary framework built entirely on Bitcoin.  
It introduces a dual-token system designed to merge stability with decentralization:  
*BitAnchor (bUSD)* ‚Äî a stablecoin pegged to the value of 1 USD in satoshis of Bitcoin, and  
*SatStandard (sBTC)* ‚Äî a tokenized representation of value denominated directly in Bitcoin units.  
Together, they aim to transform Bitcoin into a true unit of account for global commerce, enabling stable, predictable, and decentralized transactions.

---

## Vision
The BTC Standard Protocol envisions a world where prices, wages, and savings are denominated in Bitcoin rather than fiat currency.  
Instead of relying on unstable monetary policies, this system introduces a *Bitcoin-based financial standard* that offers stability, transparency, and long-term sustainability.  
Our mission is to make Bitcoin *the global monetary base* ‚Äî not only a store of value, but also a functional medium of exchange and unit of account.

## Architecture Overview
The BTC Standard Protocol consists of four fundamental layers:

| Layer | Name | Function |
|-------|------|-----------|
| üåê *Foundational Layer* | *BTC Standard Protocol* | Defines the Bitcoin-based monetary model and governs issuance and conversions. |
| üí∞ *Stablecoin* | *BitAnchor (bUSD)* | A Bitcoin-backed stablecoin representing the value of 1 USD in satoshis of BTC. |
| ‚ö° *Bitcoinized Unit* | *SatStandard (sBTC)* | Expresses all prices and transactions directly in satoshis ‚Äî the Bitcoinized metric standard. |
| üèõ *Governance Entity* | *MonetaBTC Foundation* | Oversees auditing, transparency, and community governance for the protocol. |

## Token Model

### 1. BitAnchor (bUSD)
BitAnchor is a stablecoin fully collateralized and anchored to Bitcoin.  
Its value *always equals 1 USD in satoshis of BTC*, automatically adjusting as Bitcoin‚Äôs market price changes.  
This allows individuals and businesses to hold, send, and receive a stable asset *without relying on fiat banks or centralized stablecoins*.  

- *Peg:* 1 bUSD = value of 1 USD in BTC (satoshis)  
- *Purpose:* global trade, payments, and liquidity  
- *Advantage:* stability without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem  

### 2. SatStandard (sBTC)
SatStandard represents the *‚ÄúBitcoinized‚Äù unit of value*, enabling markets and software systems to price goods and services in satoshis.  
While bUSD provides stability, sBTC defines the standard ‚Äî transforming Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a true monetary system.  

- *Peg:* 1 sBTC = 1 satoshi  
- *Purpose:* accounting, pricing, and microtransactions  
- *Advantage:* universal denomination of value across the Bitcoin economy

## Benefits

The BTC Standard Protocol provides a bridge between Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized foundation and the global economy.  

### For individuals:
- Access to stability while remaining in the Bitcoin ecosystem  
- Simplified payments and global remittances  
- Protection from fiat currency inflation  

### For businesses and merchants:
- Ability to price goods and services in Bitcoinized units (sBTC)  
- Receive payments in *BitAnchor (bUSD)* ‚Äî a stable Bitcoin-based unit always equal to *1 USD in satoshis*,  
  ensuring *predictable pricing and immunity from Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility*  
- Easier accounting and international trade settlements  
- A single global currency layer independent of banks and fiat rates  

This mechanism allows the global economy to operate under a *Bitcoin-denominated standard* while preserving price stability ‚Äî a major step toward mass adoption.

## Governance and Transparency
The *MonetaBTC Foundation* will act as a transparent governance entity responsible for audits, reserve verifications, and the progressive decentralization of the system.  
All smart contracts and reserves will be publicly verifiable on-chain, ensuring full transparency and user trust.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Milestone | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| üß± *Phase 1* | Protocol Draft | Whitepaper publication and repository launch |
| ‚öô *Phase 2* | Token Architecture | Smart contract definitions and simulation models |
| üí∞ *Phase 3* | BitAnchor (bUSD) Launch | Deployment and first exchange integrations |
| ‚ö° *Phase 4* | SatStandard (sBTC) Activation | Launch of the Bitcoin-denominated pricing layer |
| üåç *Phase 5* | Global Adoption | Merchant onboarding, payment gateways, and open DeFi integration |

---

## Conclusion
The BTC Standard Protocol proposes a practical and philosophical evolution of Bitcoin ‚Äî from a store of value to a global standard of measurement, pricing, and exchange.  
Through the combined power of *bUSD* and *sBTC, the protocol paves the way for an economy that is **stable, decentralized, and truly Bitcoin-native*.
