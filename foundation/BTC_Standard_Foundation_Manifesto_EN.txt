# 📜 BTC Standard Foundation Manifesto
## The Satoshi Standard Vision

---

### 1. The Crisis of Monetary Reference
The global financial system relies on fiat currencies that continuously lose value.  
Governments expand money supply without restraint, eroding purchasing power and distorting true market prices.  
Money is no longer a stable measure of value — it has become a tool of control.  

---

### 2. Bitcoin as the New Pillar of Stability
Bitcoin emerges as the first truly neutral and incorruptible currency.  
Its supply is finite, predictable, and mathematically guaranteed.  
Yet Bitcoin is not widely used as a unit of account — it remains a store of value, not a reference.  
The BTC Standard Protocol aims to change that: redefining global value under the Bitcoin Standard.  

---

### 3. The Emergence of the BTC Standard Protocol
The **BTC Standard Protocol** establishes the architecture of a new monetary order —  
a framework where all prices and assets are expressed in **satoshis**, not in dollars.  
It bridges the gap between the fiat world and Bitcoin-based economics,  
building an ecosystem founded on stability, transparency, and financial self-sovereignty.  

---

### 4. The Dual Monetary System: bUSD and sBTC
The protocol introduces two complementary tokens:  

- **💰 bUSD (BitAnchor)** — A stablecoin pegged to the USD value in Bitcoin.  
  Provides operational stability and liquidity for everyday transactions.  

- **⚡ sBTC (SatStandard)** — A unit of account denominated in satoshis.  
  Serves as a universal metric, enabling goods and services to be priced directly in Bitcoin.  

Together, they unite the strengths of stability and decentralization, creating a complete monetary ecosystem.

### 5. The MonetaBTC Foundation and the Future of the Satoshi Standard
The **MonetaBTC Foundation** is the guardian of the protocol.  
Its mission is to preserve decentralization, transparency, and progressive development.  
No single entity controls the BTC Standard — it belongs to the community.  

In the coming years, our mission is clear:  
**To make the satoshi the global language of value.**
