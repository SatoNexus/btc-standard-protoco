# ðŸª™ BTC Standard Protocol â€“ Tokenomics Overview

## 1. Overview
The BTC Standard Protocol operates under a **dual-token monetary model** designed to merge Bitcoinâ€™s scarcity with global usability.  
Each token has a distinct role:

| Token | Name | Function | Collateral |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| ðŸ’° **bUSD (BitAnchor)** | Stablecoin | Represents 1 USD in BTC value | 100% BTC |
| âš¡ **sBTC (SatStandard)** | Unit of account token | Expresses prices directly in satoshis | Algorithmic parity |

---

## 2. Token 1 â€” bUSD (BitAnchor)
- **Purpose:** Operational stability for everyday transactions.  
- **Peg Mechanism:** 1 bUSD = BTC value of 1 USD (based on real-time BTC/USD oracle).  
- **Collateralization:** Fully backed by Bitcoin held in decentralized reserves.  
- **Mint/Burn Process:** Users deposit BTC â†’ mint bUSD ; redeem bUSD â†’ receive BTC.  
- **Use Cases:**
  - Payments and remittances  
  - Hedging against BTC volatility  
  - Gateway for DeFi operations (DEX liquidity, lending, yield protocols)

## 3. Token 2 â€” sBTC (SatStandard)
- **Purpose:** Serve as a **Bitcoinized unit of account**.  
- **Value Reference:** 1 sBTC = 1 satoshi (1 / 100,000,000 BTC).  
- **Utility:**
  - Used for **pricing goods, assets, and contracts** directly in satoshis.  
  - Acts as a **base unit** for on-chain accounting and smart contracts.  
- **Supply Model:** Elastic and non-speculative â€” minted for measurement, not profit.  
- **Goal:** Transition from fiat valuation to a pure BTC-denominated economy.

## 4. Interaction Between bUSD and sBTC
| Mechanism | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Exchange Parity** | Smart contracts allow 1 bUSD to always equal BTC value of 1 USD in sBTC units. |
| **Oracle Feeds** | BTC/USD price feeds update the conversion ratio every block epoch. |
| **Stability Mechanism** | Arbitrage and mint/burn actions keep the peg consistent without central authority. |

## 5. Governance & Foundation Role
- **MonetaBTC Foundation** maintains oracle transparency, protocol audits, and version control.  
- Community voting governs parameter adjustments (e.g., collateral ratio, oracle sources).  
- Treasury funds are held in multi-sig Bitcoin vaults.

---

## 6. Long-Term Vision
The **BTC Standard** aims to make **satoshis the global measure of value**,  
while bUSD ensures smooth transition and stability during adoption.  
Together, they embody *The Satoshi Standard â€” a decentralized monetary future.*
